# Introduction

DocStack is a powerful layer framework designed to streamline data modeling, validation, and transformation for NoSQL databases. By introducing a structured, schema-driven approach to a typically schema-less environment, DocStack helps developers build robust, reliable, and maintainable applications.

## Why DocStack?

In the world of NoSQL, developers often face challenges with data consistency and application logic. Without a rigid schema, it's easy for data to become disorganized, leading to bugs and increased maintenance overhead. DocStack solves this by providing a programmatic way to:

* **Define Data Models:** Create clear, class-based representations of your data.
* **Enforce Validation:** Ensure data integrity by validating incoming and outgoing data against your defined schemas.
* **Transform Data:** Easily convert data between different formats and apply business logics to suit your application's needs.

## Key Features

* **Model-Based Abstraction:** Define your data using simple, intuitive classes. This approach centralizes your data logic, making it easier to manage and scale your application.
* **Event-Driven Architecture:** DocStack leverages event emission to allow for seamless integration with other parts of your application. Respond to data changes, trigger side effects, and build reactive systems with ease.
* **Built-in REST API Provisioning:** DocStack includes an Express-based system to automatically provision a REST API from your data models. This feature significantly reduces boilerplate code, allowing you to get a functional API up and running in minutes.
* **Adapter-Based Flexibility:** Designed with an adapter pattern, DocStack can be extended to work with various NoSQL databases. The framework currently provides a robust implementation for **PouchDB** (specifically its Node.js adapter). Planned future integrations include **MongoDB** and **Firebase Firestore**, ensuring your application can grow with your needs.

## How It Works

At its core, DocStack operates as a middleware between your application and your NoSQL database.

1.  **Define your data classes:** You start by defining your data models using DocStack's core classes.
2.  **Attach the adapter:** Connect your models to your chosen database adapter, such as the `PouchDB` adapter.
3.  **Use the models:** Interact with your data using the model classes. DocStack handles the validation, transformation, and communication with the database behind the scenes.
4.  **Provision the API:** Optionally, use the built-in Express functionality to expose your models via a RESTful API.

Whether you're building a simple prototype or a complex, production-ready application, DocStack provides the tools you need to build with confidence on NoSQL.
